Real-Time DSP Applications
============================

This is a set of course notes that I am writing for EEE 4511C, which
is a senior-level course that introduces students to the basic
practices of high-speed implementation of digital signal processing
objects, such as FIR/IIR filters and FFT, using a modern heterogeneous
system-on-chip hardware platform and development tools.
